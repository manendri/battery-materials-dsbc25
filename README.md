# Discovering Next-Gen Battery Materials

## Project Overview

#### Background
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to reliably predict the band gaps (regression task) of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on different physical and chemical features. The target property—band gaps—is obtained from the QMOF database, which is built upon high-level quantum chemical calculations that are computationally expensive. By applying data-driven approaches to bypass the traditional DFT pipeline, we aim to accelerate the discovery of MOFs with desirable electronic properties for energy storage applications, such as next-generation batteries

#### KPIs
1. Prediction accuracy of band gaps
2. Increased throughput of MOF screening, compared to DFT
#### Stakeholders
1. Energy storage industry 
2. Battery manufacturers
3. Experimental chemists and computational researchers in novel materials design and discovery
