# Discovering Next-Gen Battery Materials

## Project Overview

#### Background
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to reliably predict the band gaps (regression task) of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on computationally derived physical and chemical properties. Such efforts at high-throughput screening can accelerate the identification of MOFs with desirable electronic properties for energy storage applications like next generation batteries.

#### KPIs
1. Prediction accuracy of band gaps
2. Screening efficiency in identifying top candidate MOFs with electrically conductive properties
3. Experimental guidance & validation
#### Stakeholders
1. Energy storage industry 
2. Battery manufacturers
3. Experimental chemists and computational researchers in novel materials design and discovery
#### Modeling Approach
