# Discovering Next-Gen Battery Materials

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the requirements for the Spring 2025 Data Science Boot Camp organized by the Erdős Institute.

#### Background
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to reliably predict the **band gaps** (regression task) of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on different physical and chemical features. The target property—band gaps—is obtained from the QMOF database, which is built upon high-level quantum chemical calculations (_i. e._, DFT: Density Functional Theory) that are computationally expensive. By applying data-driven approaches to bypass the traditional DFT pipeline, we aim to accelerate the discovery of MOFs with desirable electronic properties for energy storage applications, such as next-generation batteries.

#### KPIs
1. Prediction accuracy of band gaps
2. Increased throughput of MOF screening compared to DFT
#### Stakeholders
1. Energy storage industry 
2. Battery manufacturers
3. Experimental chemists and computational researchers in novel materials design and discovery
## Datasets
We use the [QMOF database](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00796-6#data-availability) available at [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/mofs). This consists of ~20k theoretical MOF structures and their DFT-derived properties, including the target property **band gap**. Our machine learning models are trained on a subset of ~10k data from this dataset, selected for having the most accurately computed band gaps.
